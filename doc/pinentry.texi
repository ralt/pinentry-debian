@top Introduction
@cindex introduction

This manual documents how to use the @pinentry{} and its protocol.

The @pinentry{} is a small GUI application used to enter PINs or
passphrases. It is usually invoked by @sc{gpg-agent}
(@pxref{Invoking GPG-AGENT, ,Invoking the gpg-agent, gnupg,
    The `GNU Privacy Guard' Manual}, for details).       

@pinentry{} comes in several flavors to fit the look and feel of the
used GUI toolkit: A @sc{GTK+} based one named @code{pinentry-gtk}; a
@sc{Qt} based one named @code{pinentry-qt}; and, two non-graphical
ones @code{pinentry-curses}, which uses curses, and
@code{pinentry-tty}, which doesn't require anything more than a simple
terminal.  Not all of them are necessarily available on your
installation.  If curses is supported on your system, the GUI-based
flavors fall back to curses when the @code{DISPLAY} variable is not
set.

@chapter How to use the @pinentry{}

@c man begin DESCRIPTION

You may run @pinentry{} directly from the command line and pass the
commands according to the Assuan protocol via stdin/stdout.


@c man end

@c man begin OPTIONS

Here is a list of options supported by all flavors of pinentry:

@table @gnupgtabopt
@item --version
@opindex version
Print the program version and licensing information. 

@item --help
@opindex help
Print a usage message summarizing the most useful command line options.

@item --debug
@itemx -d
@opindex debug
@opindex d
Turn on some debugging.  Mostly useful for the maintainers.  Note that
this may reveal sensitive information like the entered passphrase.

@c @item --enhanced
@c @itemx -e
@c @opindex enhanced
@c @opindex e
@c Ask for timeouts and insurance, too.  Note that this is currently not
@c fully supported.

@item --no-global-grab
@itemx -g
@opindex no-global-grab
@opindex g
Grab the keyboard only when the window is focused.  Use this option if
you are debugging software using the @pinentry{}; otherwise you may
not be able to to access your X session anymore (unless you have other
means to connect to the machine to kill the @pinentry{}).

@item --parent-wid @var{n}
@opindex parent-wid
Use window ID @var{n} as the parent window for positioning the window.
Note, that this is not fully supported by all flavors of @pinentry{}.

@item --timeout @var{seconds}
@opindex timeout
Give up waiting for input from the user after the specified number of
seconds and return an error. The error returned is the same as if the
Cancel button was selected. To disable the timeout and wait
indefinitely, set this to 0, which is the default.

@item --display @var{string}
@itemx --ttyname @var{string}
@itemx --ttytype @var{string}
@itemx --lc-ctype @var{string}
@itemx --lc-messages @var{string}
@opindex display 
@opindex ttyname 
@opindex ttytype 
@opindex lc-ctype 
@opindex lc-messa
These options are used to pass localization information to
@pinentry{}.  They are required because @pinentry{} is usually called
by some background process which does not have any information about
the locale and terminal to use.  It is also possible to pass these
options using Assuan protocol options.
@end table

@c 
@c  Assuan Protocol
@c
@node Protocol
@chapter @pinentry{}'s Assuan Protocol

The @pinentry{} should never service more than one connection at once.
It is reasonable to exec the @pinentry{} prior to a request.

The @pinentry{} does not need to stay in memory because the
@sc{gpg-agent} has the ability to cache passphrases.  The usual way to
run the @pinentry{} is by setting up a pipe (not a socket) and then
fork/exec the @pinentry{}.  The communication is then done by means of
the protocol described here until the client is satisfied with the
result.

Although it is called a @pinentry{}, it allows entering reasonably
long strings (strings that are up to 2048 characters long are
supported by every pinentry).  The client using the @pinentry{} has to
check for correctness.

Note that all strings are expected to be encoded as UTF-8; @pinentry{}
takes care of converting it to the locally used codeset.  To include
linefeeds or other special characters, you may percent-escape them
(e.g., a line feed is encoded as @code{%0A}, the percent sign itself
is encoded as @code{%25}, etc.).

The following is a list of supported commands:

@table @gnupgtabopt

@item Set the timeout before returning an error
@example
  C: SETTIMEOUT 30
  S: OK
@end example

@item Set the descriptive text to display
@example
  C: SETDESC Enter PIN for Richard Nixon <nobody@@trickydicky.gov>
  S: OK
@end example

@item Set the prompt to show
When asking for a PIN, set the text just before the widget for
passphrase entry.
@example
  C: SETPROMPT PIN:
  S: OK
@end example

You should use an underscore in the text only if you know that a
modern version of pinentry is used.  Modern versions underline the
next character after the underscore and use the first such underlined
character as a keyboard accelerator.  Use a double underscore to
escape an underscore.

@item Set the window title
This command may be used to change the default window title.  When
using this feature you should take care that the window is still
identifiable as the pinentry.
@example
  C: SETTITLE Tape Recorder Room
  S: OK
@end example

@item Set the button texts
There are three texts which should be used to override the English
defaults:

To set the text for the button signaling confirmation (in UTF-8).
See SETPROMPT on how to use an keyboard accelerator.
@example
  C: SETOK Yes
  S: OK
@end example


To set the text for the button signaling cancellation or disagreement
(in UTF-8).  See SETPROMPT on how to use an keyboard accelerator.
@example
  C: SETCANCEL No
  S: OK
@end example


In case three buttons are required, use the following command to set
the text (UTF-8) for the non-affirmative response button.  The
affirmative button text is still set using SETOK and the CANCEL button
text with SETCANCEL.  See SETPROMPT on how to use an keyboard
accelerator.
@example
  C: SETNOTOK Do not do this
  S: OK
@end example



@item Set the Error text
This is used by the client to display an error message.  In contrast
to the other commands, the error message is automatically reset with
a GETPIN or CONFIRM, and is only displayed when asking for a PIN.
@example
  C: SETERROR Invalid PIN entered - please try again
  S: OK
@end example

@item Enable a passphrase quality indicator
Adds a quality indicator to the GETPIN window.  This indicator is
updated as the passphrase is typed.  The clients needs to implement an
inquiry named "QUALITY" which gets passed the current passpharse
(percent-plus escaped) and should send back a string with a single
numerical vauelue between -100 and 100.  Negative values will be
displayed in red.
@example
  C: SETQUALITYBAR
  S: OK
@end example

If a custom label for the quality bar is required, just add that label
as an argument as a percent-escaped string.  You will need this
feature to translate the label because @pinentry{} has no internal
gettext except for stock strings from the toolkit library.

If you want to show a tooltip for the quality bar, you may use
@example
  C: SETQUALITYBAR_TT string
  S: OK
@end example

@noindent
With STRING being a percent escaped string shown as the tooltip.


@item Ask for a PIN
The meat of this tool is to ask for a passphrase of PIN, it is done with
this command:
@example
  C: GETPIN
  S: D no more tapes
  S: OK
@end example
Note that the passphrase is transmitted in clear using standard data
responses.  Expect it to be in UTF-8.

@item Ask for confirmation
To ask for a confirmation (yes or no), you can use this command:
@example
  C: CONFIRM
  S: OK
@end example
The client should use SETDESC to set an appropriate text before
issuing this command, and may use SETPROMPT to set the button texts.
The value returned is either OK for YES or the error code
@code{ASSUAN_Not_Confirmed}.

@item Show a message
To show a message, you can use this command:
@example
  C: MESSAGE
  S: OK
@end example
alternatively you may add an option to confirm:
@example
  C: CONFIRM --one-button
  S: OK
@end example
The client should use SETDESC to set an appropriate text before issuing
this command, and may use SETOK to set the text for the dismiss button.
The value returned is OK or an error message.

@item Set the output device
When using X, the @pinentry{} program must be invoked with an
appropriate @code{DISPLAY} environment variable or the
@code{--display} option.

When using a text terminal:
@example
  C: OPTION ttyname=/dev/tty3
  S: OK
  C: OPTION ttytype=vt100
  S: OK
  C: OPTION lc-ctype=de_DE.UTF-8
  S: OK
@end example
The client should use the @code{ttyname} option to set the output TTY
file name, the @code{ttytype} option to the @code{TERM} variable
appropriate for this tty and @code{lc-ctype} to the locale which
defines the character set to use for this terminal.

@item Set the default strings
To avoid having translations in Pinentry proper, the caller may set
certain translated strings which are used by @pinentry{} as default
strings.

@example
  C: OPTION default-ok=_Korrekt
  S: OK
  C: OPTION default-cancel=Abbruch
  S: OK
  C: OPTION default-prompt=PIN eingeben:
  S: OK
@end example
The strings are subject to accelerator marking, see SETPROMPT for
details.

@item Passphrase caching

Some environments, such as GNOME, cache passwords and passphrases.
The @pinentry{} should only use an external cache if the
@code{allow-external-password-cache} option was set and a stable key
identifier (using SETKEYINFO) was provided.  In this case, if the
passphrase was read from the cache, the @pinentry{} should send the
@code{PASSWORD_FROM_CACHE} status message before returning the
passphrase.  This indicates to GPG Agent that it should not increment
the passphrase retry counter.

@example
  C: OPTION allow-external-password-cache
  S: OK
  C: SETKEYINFO key-grip
  S: OK
  C: getpin
  S: S PASSWORD_FROM_CACHE
  S: D 1234
  C: OK
@end example

Note: if @code{allow-external-password-cache} is not specified, an
external password cache must not be used: this can lead to subtle
bugs.  In particular, if this option is not specified, then GPG Agent
does not recognize the @code{PASSWORD_FROM_CACHE} status message and
will count trying a cached password against the password retry count.
If the password retry count is 1, then the user will never have the
opportunity to correct the cached password.

Note: it is strongly recommended that a pinentry supporting this
feature provide the user an option to enable it manually.  That is,
saving a passphrase in an external password manager should be opt-in.

The key identifier provided SETKEYINFO must be considered opaque and
may change in the future.  It currently has the form
@code{X/HEXSTRING} where @code{X} is either @code{n}, @code{s}, or
@code{u}.  In the former two cases, the HEXSTRING corresponds to the
key grip.  The key grip is not the OpenPGP Key ID, but it can be
mapped to the key using the following:

@example
  # gpg2 --with-keygrip --list-secret-keys
@end example

@noindent
and searching the output for the key grip.  The same command-line
options can also be used with gpgsm.
